Arguably the second most important button on Camera FV-5 —after the shutter button of course— is the settings button. It opens the settings panel, where you can adjust the rest of the settings of Camera FV-5 not present on the main screen. Operation with the settings panel is usual for the advanced photographer, and it provides extensive configuration of your camera. Photo encoding settings, photo organization options, advanced photographic parameters or viewfinder adjustments are just some of the options found on the settings panel.
