# Program modes, shooting utilities and flash settings

At the left side of the viewfinder, from top to bottom, the following settings are located:

## Program mode

![Program mode](../images/icons/program_auto.png)

Here you can see the current selected exposure program mode and change it by tapping on it and selecting a new one from the popup menu. Read more on section _[Exposure program](../exposure-program/)_.

## Shooting utilities

![Shooting utilities](../images/icons/menu.png)

Contains different shooting utilities.

| Symbol | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| ![AEB](../images/icons/bracketing.png) | __Automatic exposure bracketing.__ Takes pictures with different exposure compensations. Read more on section _[Automatic exposure bracketing](../aeb/)_. |
| ![Intervalometer](../images/icons/intervalometer.png) | __Intervalometer.__ Takes picture series and timelapses. Read more on section _[Intervalometer](../intervalometer/)_. |
| ![Self-timer](../images/icons/selftimer_base.png) | __Self-timer.__ |
| ![Image stabilization](../images/icons/antishake.png) | __Image stabilization.__ Activates or deactivates the image stabilization. On most devices, this is digital image stabilization. If image stabilization is not supported on the device this button might not be present. |
| ![Burst mode](../images/icons/burst_indicator.png) | __Burst mode.__ Activates or deactivates the burst mode. When the burst mode is active, tapping and holding the virtual shutter button or the shutter key (if the device has one) will result in a continuous flow of photos being taken, as long as the virtual shutter button or the shutter key are not released. |
| ![Touch capture](../images/icons/capture_tap.png) | __Touch capture mode.__ |

### Self-timer

![Self-timer](../images/icons/selftimer_base.png)

Takes pictures after a predefined time interval. You can tap on this mode to select 2, 5 or 10 seconds delay, as well as to deactivate the self-timer. When the self-timer is active, tapping on either the virtual or physical shutter button takes the picture after the predefined interval.

This mode can be useful (but not only) for:

* Taking self-portraits.
* Taking photos on a tripod in low light conditions avoiding the blur caused by the finger moving the camera when activating the shutter button.

### Touch capture mode

![Touch capture mode](../images/icons/capture_tap.png)

Activates or deactivates the touch capture mode. When this mode is active, after tapping anywhere on the viewfinder, the camera will take a photo immediately. This can be useful in two scenarios:

* Take _selfies_ with the rear camera. You can point the rear camera to you, and then tap anywhere on the screen. Camera FV-5 will adjust focus as usual (depending on the current focus mode) and then will capture a photo. Since you cannot see the screen in this case, the touch capture mode helps you to take the photo by tapping anywhere on the viewfinder.
* Take effectively photos of moving objects when using touch focus mode. When taking pictures of moving objects, the delay between tapping on the subject to focus on that position and take the photo might be enough for the object to move and the focus to be lost. When using touch capture mode, the photo will be taken immediately after setting the focus position, reducing the possibility of missed focus.

## Flash mode

Lets you choose the flash mode. Depending of the type of the flash unit and the device, the available options are:

| Symbol | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| ![Automatic](../images/icons/flash_auto_2.png) | __Automatic.__ The flash is fired if the camera considers the lighting conditions require additional illumination. |
| ![Always on](../images/icons/flash_base_2.png) | __Always on.__ The flash is always fired regardless of lighting conditions. |
| ![Always off](../images/icons/flash_off_2.png) | __Always off.__ The flash is never fired even if the scene is poorly lit.
| ![Slow sync](../images/icons/flash_slow_sync_2.png) | __Slow sync.__ The flash is fired in slow sync mode. In slow sync mode, the exposure time is adjusted as if the flash wasnâ€™t going to be fired. This captures extra light from the background of the subject while the flash is used to freeze the main subject. |
| ![Red eye](../images/icons/flash_red_eye_2.png) | __Red eye.__ The camera fires the flash twice. The first time (the pre-flash) uses a low power discharge to cause the iris of the eyes present on the photo to close, minimizing the effect of red eyes when the main, full-power flash fires and the camera captures the photo. |
| ![Red eye fix](../images/icons/flash_red_eye_fix_2.png) | __Red eye fix.__ The flash fires as usual but the camera removes red eyes from the picture digitally (locating them and replacing the color with black). |
| ![Continuous](../images/icons/flash_continuous_2.png) | __Continuous.__ If the flash is of LED type, the flash is permanently turned on, allowing you to preview the effect of the flash on the final photo while you frame it. This option is not available if the flash is of xenon type. |

!!! tip "Tip: screem front-camera flash"
    If you use the front camera, even if it does not have a front flash, the flash setting **always on** will still be available. In that case, the screen will briefly turn white at maximum brightness to serve as flash. This, although cannot compensate a true flash, works good enough in low light environments.

!!! note
    If the device lacks a flash unit, the flash mode button will be hidden.
