If you require help with photographic-related concepts, there are many online resources for general photographic concepts as well as tips, suggestions and techniques. One of our favorites is Cambridge In Colour (http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/). It contains multiple tutorials in many categories that go from basic photographic concepts to advanced techniques, and from the camera to the computer techniques to edit the photographs. It is a very worth read!
