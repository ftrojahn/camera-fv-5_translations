When you enable RAW capture, you will get JPEG+DNG (i.e. both developed and raw images). The RAW photos are stored as DNG files. The file names match the ones of the JPEG files that you can completely customize. Also, DNG files are stored on the same folder used to store the JPEG images, and you can choose any folder on your internal memory to store your pictures.

!!! note
    RAW images are processed in the background, and take substantially longer to write, since the raw image sizes are considerably bigger than JPEG images.
