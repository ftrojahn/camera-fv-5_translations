Lets you set the exposure time manually. There are two different versions of the dialog for setting the exposure time depending on which device you are running Camera FV-5 on.

## Mobile phones running Android 4.4 KitKat or older

On mobile phones running Android 4.4 KitKat or older, there is no specific exposure time control (like in fractions of seconds) like traditional cameras, given a limitation of the operating system and closed camera drivers. Therefore, the only available options for setting the exposure time are some presets.

* __Short.__ Forces a short exposure time suitable for handheld shooting. On most devices this gives 1/30s or shorter.
* __Long.__ Forces a long exposure. On most devices, this gives ½ of a second to 1” exposure time.
* __Long+.__ Forces a longer exposure. On most devices, this gives 1” to 2” exposure time.

There are also some presets for long exposure (1”, 2” and 5”) but you can also manually select the exposure time from 0.3 to 60” with an accuracy of 0.1 seconds. Those open shutter modes are actually digitally composed long exposure photos that don’t provide the same quality as true long exposure provided by real cameras. Also, the photo resolution on this mode drops to 1 MP to 2 MP depending on the device, because the live view is used to produce the long exposure photograph.

## Mobile phones with Android 5.0 Lollipop or newer, and Android-based compact cameras

The dialog simply provides an exposure time scale where you can select manually the exposure time. The range of exposure times you can select is device-dependent, the same for the number of steps between the maximum and minimum exposure times. The exposure times are shown as fractions of seconds up to 0.4”, and then as decimal numbers onwards. The exposure time scale is logarithmic.
