# Live histogram

The histogram is a powerful guide to evaluate a photo exposure.

A histogram is a graph that counts how many occurrences of a particular brightness channel has. In case of color photos, there are three color channels (red, green and blue) each with its own intensities, whereas in black and white images thereâ€™s only one luminance channel. Also, even with color images, you can opt to get a luminance-only histogram. Internally, the picture is converted to grayscale to calculate the histogram.

## Activating the live histogram

Go to `Settings > Viewfinder > Live histogram` and activate **Show histogram**. The histogram is calculated in real time and changes when you move the camera or the subject, or you change settings that affect the lightning or color distribution.

## Histogram types

In `Settings > Viewfinder > Live histogram > Histogram type` you can select:

* __RGB (3 color channels).__ This option is only available when taking color photos.
* __Luminance.__ This option is also available when taking color photos. It shows the luminance histogram of the viewfinder converted to grayscale.

Furthermore, you can adjust the size of the graphs in **Histogram size** (**Normal** and **Mini**) and the style of the histogram in **Histogram style** (**Transparent** or **Solid**).
